#python-api-challeng
The goal was to create a script to visualize weather patterns for over 500 cities across the world via API calls and looping. Then plot the data and showcase the relationships between various factors. For the second part, we were to use the data from the first excercise to use a new API call and find hotel data based on certain cities that had "ideal" conditions from the first part. Then we were tasked with plotting those on a geo map.
